Week 4 Monash Data Course Homework


We were presented with purchase data for a fantasy game, Heroes of Pymori, and asked to perform some analyses on the dataset.

Created an overview of the Total Purchasing, then broke it down by Gender and ran the same analysis again, then broke it down by Age (composing bins of 5 year increments) and analysed again.

For each overview, we ran analysis on the Purchase Count, Average Purchase Price, Total Purchase Value. For the overall Total Purchasing we calcualted the Total Revenue, and for Gender and Age breakdowns we found the Average Purchase Total per Person.

Further we listed out the most popular and most profitable items, by sorting the data summarised from the purchasing history of each item.

We then drew 3 insights from the overall data outputs;
  1. Heroes of Pymori has had more male players (84.03%) make purchases than female (14.06%) and other/non-disclosed gendered players (1.91%), however female players make higher value purchases per person ($4.47)

  2. The age range between 20-24 have made the most purchases (365 total) and generated the highest revenue (1,114.06), however the 35-39 bracket make higher value purchases per person ($4.76)

  3. The "Final Critic" is the most popular and most profitable item in Heroes of Pymori
